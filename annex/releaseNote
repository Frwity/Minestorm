ACCES PATH FOR MATH :

	- src/2d_tools.c		Tool box for 2D space / referencial related
	- src/collision.c		SAT and AABB
	- src/game_collision.c	Use of SAT for game logic

	- src/draw.c:54			personalized star creating process

	- at the beginning of src/player.c src/mother_ship.c src/mine.c
		there is the creation of the game object

	- src/player.c:275 iterial move for player

THE GAME :

- Starting Screen
	- all key display
	- choice for two player

- HUD :-Score
       - Life for both players
	   - AABB can be shown
	   - The second player can be added at any time
	   - Backgroud and foreground

- Game pause

- Game Over :  - Player1 (and Player2) life is 0

- 1 or 2 Players :  
			   - Can move forward and rotate according to Newton equation
               - Score increase when ennemis died
			   - Player lose 1 life when hit by a mine or a bullet and is teleported randomly
               - A player can shoot only 10 bullets at the same time
               - Player and enemys bullets can hit each other
			   - Can teleport randomly
			   - Teleport with border

			   - (a part of the player is displayed when at a border, as its just the continuity of the space)

- Enemies :    - 4 types of mine, floating, magnetic, fireball and magnetic-fireball
			   - The magnetic mines move in the direction of the player (only player 1)
			   - The fireball mines shoot in direction of the player when hit by players bullet (direction of player 1)
			   - the non-magnetic mines move in a random direction
			   - Teleport with border
			   - When all mine are defeated a new waves spawn with more difficulty 
			   - Mine spawned on 'spawnpoint' bring by a mother ship animated at the start of any level
			   - When a Mine is destroyed, 2 smaller appear on spawpoint, they are 3 different size


TO BUILD AND RUN PROJECT :

	- Build : "make"

	- Run : "./bin/minestorm.exe"

BUGS :

	- Sometimes when exiting the game or restarting in specific case, a invalid free happen

ENDNOTE :

	- The code is not finished decomposed, so there is some long functions
